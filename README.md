# The first question

Gasp! You finally have it!   

It's a black shiny box that can talk to any other black shiny box, anywhere in the Universe, at the speed of light.  
Some say it's a quantum communication dream, never to be achieved.   
But you've built it in your basement from dubious scrap parts.  
How much will this be worth and how can i extract said value?
    
You now have to:  
  
a. Obtain funding so that  
b. You can build a core team and a HR    
c. To hire other people in order to  
d. Come up with a pricing plan for preorders and advertise them to prove viability to future investors that:  
* finding a manufacturing partner  
* finding distributors in key markets  
* building or adapting enterprise software to keep track of money in/money out, orders, payroll, etc  
is worth spending on 
    so that  
e. You can obtain a future investment if preorders go well so that
* [cue further operations all INNOVATORS love, such as settig up an accounting and legal department]    

Glorious work - and in-between having everything outright stolen to losing your sanity most people say - i shall never leave my basement!  
Which is a stupid way to setup an economy, considering it removes the incentive to it's no. 1 growth factor - INNOVATION!  
Nevermind the economy - what's next for you?

You wake up from the trip on a cold, marble floor. With the crispness only a good night's sleep paird with enhancing substances can give you, you now realize a chilling fact: even though your aha-moment is undoubtedly valueable, your theory for the black shiny box lacks crucial knowledge outside your expertise. And never in your life have you met someone that works in the field. And how could you even trust them to share your work? And how would you incentivize them to work on your idea?

You dress and go to work. Is it possible to escape this?
