# Introduction  

This paper argues that being fair, transparent, borderless, and permissionless sets the optimal prerequisites for innovation.

1. Nature sets the right conditions for growth:  
   
   a. Simple rules that maximize composability.  
   b. Reuse of solutions (often through recursion).  
   c. Energy minimization.  

2. Innovation is:  

   a. A chain of simple "aha" moments with good explanations that are hard to vary  
   b. Built on previous "aha" moments (reuse, recursion), so that  
   c. Energy use is minimized for adopters.  

3. OpenSpur is a self-evolving protocol (using the protocol itself) that is:  

   a. Simple (one rule applied recursively to evaluate each contribution).  
   b. Reuses existing solutions and makes them easy to discover and plug in.  
   c. Minimizes the energy required to build(proper skill to task distribution) and adopt innovation.  

OpenSpur is a collection of OpenSpur organizations that use the protocol to establish:

a. a communication highway so innovators working towards similar goals can find each other  
b. the trust layer so that they can work together  
c. the fair pay protocol that encourages full transparency and commitment from all actors.  

# Communication Highway  

We will use simple combinatorics to explain why   

a. individuals that freely associate around problems to be solved have better work satisfaction and monetary outcomes and   
b. why problems that allow and chain contributions have better chances of being solved   

This will be the motivation behind building a system that    
a. can automatically monitor novel problems to be solved on behalf of problem solvers.  
b. is open by default to contributors and chaining existing solutions  

Chaining solutions and accepting contributions is one side of the coin as open source already does this.
Accelerating the rate at which solutions are built is enabled by the fairness and fair pay protocol.

## Impact of Restricting Collaboration on Individual Output  

Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem, while originally focused on social choice theory, reveals an important insight applicable to individual and organizational contexts: when restrictions are placed on individuals’ ability to choose freely from among their preferences, the resulting system can fail to maximize fairness, representation, and overall satisfaction.  

In organizations, this principle translates into the tasks and roles individuals are allowed to take on. If individuals are locked into narrow silos—where their skills and interests are not fully utilized or aligned with their **ikigai** (a Japanese concept meaning "reason for being")—their capacity for contribution and fulfillment is diminished.  

In conclusion, simply OPENING UP a global talent marketplace we can theoretically achieve an economic system in perfect Nash equilibrium.

## Why is it important to open up organizations?  

Let’s use simple combinatorics to see how fast a simple restriction decreases the number of possibilities in the system.  

Assume we have **N** objects.  
New objects can be formed by associating no objects, all objects, or any number of objects in between **0** and **N**.  
If associating **2** objects makes the new object not viable, that’s one restriction.  

For **0** restrictions:  
- **10** objects can generate \(2^{10} = 1024\) new objects.  

For **10** restrictions:  
- **10** objects can generate \(2^{10} - \binom{10}{10} = 1014\).  

## Impact of Restricting Collaboration on System Potential 

Now imagine dividing the **10** objects into two isolated groups of **5** each. Within each group, the possible combinations drop significantly.  

For **0** restrictions:  
- Each group of **5** objects generates \(2^5 = 32\) combinations.  
- Two groups yield \(32 + 32 = 64\) combinations.  

This is drastically less than the \(1024\) combinations that could be formed if all **10** objects interacted freely in a single system.  

The same logic applies to professionals. Locking **10** professionals in one organization and another **10** in a separate organization limits their ability to freely combine their ideas, experiences, and knowledge.  

Instead of generating an exponential number of possibilities, the system becomes fragmented, with far fewer opportunities for innovation and emergence. This restriction minimizes the collective potential, reduces systemic adaptability, and stifles the emergence of groundbreaking solutions.  

# Trust layer

We believe this to be self-evident: it's impossible to share knowledge, produce novel intellectual property or contribute source-code, work, etc with no trust.  
OpenSpur is trustworthy because of the cryptographic gurantees given by the underlying blockchain architecture, and from a legal standpoint.  
We regularly file patent requests for all work produced on behalf of our contributors.

# Fair pay protocol

Negociations between individuals(who works on what), individuals and organizations(what monthly pay should i get) add friction. Specifically, treating people like a statistic is an invitation to under-perform. Motivation has 2 sides - the whip and the carrot - but in modern companies the carrot is missing, or is at any rate not proportional(let alone fair) with the contribution of the employee.

We open up a marketplace of tasks and their associated fair pay. It's up to the contributor to train an A.I. that hunts for suitable tasks, solve them, and get either the cash or the shares in the system being built. [We explore the exact mechanics by which this is accomplished in the Protocol mechanics section].

# Conclusions

We've outlined and proposed the axioms of an efficient global brain where all participants are stakeholders. The methods by which this is achieved has been intentionally left out and is considered part of the implementation mechanics that may change independently of the evolution of this document.
