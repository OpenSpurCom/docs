# Implementation

In this section a system(out of many possible) is proposed that aims to:

a. Set simple rules so that it's easy to understand and adopt  
b. Such that existing solutions are levraged and reused and new ones are built with minimum energy consumption  
c. Globally minimizes the spending of producing while maximizing the output(given the mission, funds and talent pool).  

Actors:  

investors  
problem-solvers   
entrepreneurs  
(collectively reffered to as the TALENT POOL)

contribution nodes(with reference to the parent)   
customers

Actions:


execution cycle  
dividend payout

## The protocol

### What can and can't be done using the protocol

One can use this to solve novel, thought-provoking and value-unlocking problems such as building an AGI or solving the stable qubit problem to unlock quantum computing adoption or it can be used to build the UI of a new movie streaming platform.   
It also unlocks novel use cases - under the current model, coming up with an innovation to save computing resources of 1 cent per execution for a company serving 100 million users is not monetizable. It's also impossible levraging existing operations of an existing business. If somehow you came up with a new, functioning communication device - it's both in the interest of the old telecom company to lease you their infrastructure as it is yours as the inventor to use and pay for it.

It probably can not be used for operations, such as running a support team, but it can be used to build the automation that completely replaces it.

### Structure and actions

There is one central action - chaining nodes.
A node can encapsulate knowledge or work.  
Knowledge can be a list of specifications of what needs to be built, a novel discovery(theoretical or practical) or simply clarify existing tasks.  
Work can be computer code.

Collection of nodes form organizations which combinatorical mathematics calls GRAPHS.

Individual nodes can receive investment - this measures how many dividends owning this node will yield.
Investors don't need to invest directly at the frontier of what is being built - they can invest in parents of parents of the node, in the organization or in a subset of it(by investing in the most general node that describes what that particular subgraph does).
Investing in a node that is closed to investment will trickle the funds to child nodes until a child node that is currently being funded is encountered. If no such children are present then the funds will be returned to the investor.
Funds passing through nodes add to the node's weight in the network and to the dividends being payed out. 

### Fund security

Securing funds

Every action done on this system can be vetoed, and every action has a countdown timer after which it can't be vetoed anymore.

### Dividends payout
