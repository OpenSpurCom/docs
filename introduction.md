# Introduction  

1. Nature sets the right conditions for growth:  
   
   a. Simple rules that maximize composability.  
   b. Reuse of solutions (often through recursion).  
   c. Energy minimization (set bounty on what it maximizes - the explanation will unlock better protocol mechanics).  

2. Innovation is:  

   a. A chain of simple "aha" moments with good explanations that are hard to vary  
   b. Built on previous "aha" moments (reuse, recursion), so that  
   c. Energy use is minimized for adopters.  

3. OpenSpur is a self-evolving protocol (using the protocol itself) that is:  

   a. Simple (one rule applied recursively).  
   b. Reuses existing solutions.  
   c. Accepts and fairly remunerates every meaningful contribution, minimizing the energy required to build and adopt innovation.  

We believe that being fair, transparent, borderless, and permissionless sets the optimal prerequisites for maximum economic growth.
