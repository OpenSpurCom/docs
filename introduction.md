# Introduction  

1. Nature sets the right conditions for growth:  
   
   a. Simple rules that maximize composability.  
   b. Reuse of solutions (often through recursion).  
   c. Energy minimization.  

2. Innovation is:  

   a. A chain of simple "aha" moments with good explanations that are hard to vary  
   b. Built on previous "aha" moments (reuse, recursion), so that  
   c. Energy use is minimized for adopters.  

3. OpenSpur is a self-evolving protocol (using the protocol itself) that is:  

   a. Simple (one rule applied recursively to evaluate each contribution).  
   b. Reuses existing solutions and makes them easy to discover and plug in.  
   c. Minimizes the energy required to build(proper skill to task distribution) and adopt innovation.  

We believe that being fair, transparent, borderless, and permissionless sets the optimal prerequisites for maximum economic growth.
